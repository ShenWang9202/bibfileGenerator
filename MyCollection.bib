abstract = {This work presents a data-driven reduced-order modeling framework to accelerate the computations of $N$-body dynamical systems and their pair-wise interactions. The proposed framework differs from traditional acceleration methods, like the Barnes-Hut method, which requires online tree building of the state space, or the fast-multipole method, which requires rigorous $a$ $priori$ analysis of governing kernels and online tree building. Our approach combines Barnes-Hut hierarchical decomposition, dimensional compression via the least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) projection, and hyper-reduction by way of the Gauss-Newton with approximated tensor (GNAT) approach. The resulting $projection-tree$ reduced order model (PTROM) enables a drastic reduction in operational count complexity by constructing sparse hyper-reduced pairwise interactions of the $N$-body dynamical system. As a result, the presented framework is capable of achieving an operational count complexity that is independent of $N$, the number of bodies in the numerical domain. Capabilities of the PTROM method are demonstrated on the two-dimensional fluid-dynamic Biot-Savart kernel within a parametric and reproductive setting. Results show the PTROM is capable of achieving over 2000$\times$ wall-time speed-up with respect to the full-order model, where the speed-up increases with $N$. The resulting solution delivers quantities of interest with errors that are less than 0.1$\%$ with respect to full-order model.},

abstract = {A physical parameter identification method for the linear time-varying system is presented in this paper. For an arbitrarily time-varying system, a series of Hankel matrices are established directly from the combined measurements of displacement, velocity, and acceleration together with the input excitations from a single experiment with the system. The time-varying equivalent state-space system matrices of the structure at each time instance are then identified by singular value decomposition using the free or random responses. A time-varying transformation matrix for transforming the identified equivalent system matrices into the physical system matrices is developed to determine the mass, stiffness, and damping matrices. Details of the proposed approach are investigated with a two degrees-of-freedom spring-mass-damper system with three kinds of time-varying parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed method is accurate and effective in identifying time-varying physical parameters.

@article{Baur2014,
abstract = {In the past decades, Model Order Reduction (MOR) has demonstrated its robustness and wide applicability for simulating large-scale mathematical models in engineering and the sciences. Recently, MOR has been intensively further developed for increasingly complex dynamical systems. Wide applications of MOR have been found not only in simulation, but also in optimization and control. In this survey paper, we review some popular MOR methods for linear and nonlinear large-scale dynamical systems, mainly used in electrical and control engineering, in computational electromagnetics, as well as in micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems design. This complements recent surveys on generating reduced-order models for parameter-dependent problems (Benner et al. in 2013; Boyaval et al. in Arch Comput Methods Eng 17(4):435–454, 2010; Rozza et al. Arch Comput Methods Eng 15(3):229–275, 2008) which we do not consider here. Besides reviewing existing methods and the computational techniques needed to implement them, open issues are discussed, and some new results are proposed.},

@article{Brunton2016,
abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},
