# bibfileGenerator
Generate a new bib file that is more accurate based on crossref website for TeXstudio according to the .bib file from Mendeley

1. Mendeley would give the wrong bib items most of time and we would like to generate a new bib file according to the inaccurate bib item.

2. First, we need to export all papers we would like to cite from Mendeley.

Second, all files are exported as Mycollection.bib

Third, ./cleanBib.sh Mycollection.bib newbib.bib

Finally, the cleanbib.sh uses bibertool to remove the "abstract" and "file" from each bibItem, and then use bibcure code to find the bib item from crossref according to the title.

The newbib.bib can be used by TexStudio directly. 


Besides that, we all can collect titles from mycollection.bib generated by Mendeley, and then use title2bib to generate a new bib.

First, python getTitle.py
 
Second, all titles would be extracted into a txt file named "mytitles.txt".


#todo
Third, we directly use "title2bib" (https://github.com/bibcure/title2bib) to generate a new bib according to all titles in mytitles.txt file.
