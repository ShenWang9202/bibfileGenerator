#bibfileGenerator

Generate a new bib file that is more accurate based on the crossref website for TeXstudio according to the .bib file from Mendeley

Mendeley gives the wrong bib items most of the time and we would like to generate a new bib file according to the inaccurate bib item.

First, we need to export all papers we would like to cite from Mendeley.

Second, all files are exported as "Mycollection.bib"

Third, ./cleanBib.sh Mycollection.bib newbib.bib

Finally, the "cleanbib.sh" uses bibertool to remove the "abstract" and "file" from each bibItem, and then use bibcure code to find the bib item from crossref according to the title.

This bibfileGenerator tool is developped based on:

https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/410564/mendeley-export-citation-without-abstract
https://github.com/bibcure/bibcure

The "newbib.bib" can be used by TexStudio directly. 


Besides that, we can collect titles from "Mycollection.bib" generated by Mendeley, and then use title2bib to generate a new bib.

First, python getTitle.py
 
Second, all titles would be extracted into a .txt file named "mytitles.txt".


#todo
Third, we directly use "title2bib" (https://github.com/bibcure/title2bib) to generate a new bib according to all titles in "mytitles.txt" file.
